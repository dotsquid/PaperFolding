# Paper Folding
This is a demo / proof of concept of a game whose mechanics is based on folding of the sheet of paper. Each side of the paper represents completely different environments. By folding the paper those environments could be combined as a result letting the main character reach the goal (this part is not implemented in this demo).

Implementation contains:  
1. Folding of the paper by dragging edges or corners of the sheet.
2. Character movement by tapping on the sheet.
3. Character seemlessly moves between the folds.
4. Two sides of the sheet represent different environments.
