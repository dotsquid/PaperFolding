# Paper Folding
This is a demo / proof of concept of a game whose mechanics is based on folding of the paper and as a result modifying the environment so the main character could reach the target.  
  
[Playable WebGL demo](https://dotsquid.gitlab.io/paperfoldingbuild/)
  
Implementation contains:  
1. Folding of the paper by dragging edges or corners of the sheet.
2. Character movement by tapping on the sheet.
3. Character seemlessly moves between the folds.
4. Two sides of the sheet represent different environments.
